## Paused Backlog (resume intentionally)

### UI / UX
- Hover & focus polish on cards
- Keyboard/focus accessibility pass
- Mobile nav animation refinement

### Components
- Extract reusable `<ProjectCard />`
- Extract `<Button />`, `<Card />`, `<Input />` wrappers (optional)

### Pages
- Flesh out Services page
- Expand Contact form (validation / submission)
- Case study detail pages

### Architecture
- Review component boundaries
- Evaluate when/if SCSS tokens should be activated
- Consider animation utilities (optional)

## Locked-In Decisions

- Tailwind is used **semantically**, not utility-heavy
- JSX remains clean and readable
- Layout and routing stay centralized
- Naming changes only when clearly beneficial

---

## Notes for Future Me

- All major milestones are committed and pushed
- Do not rush features before reviewing architecture
- Resume work deliberately — this project is stable
